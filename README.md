- Go to https://stakecube.net/?team=anderson.brenda and signup for the account
- Get the selenium up and running https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/
- For now run the stackcube.net.py
- manually enter the captcha 
- navigate to https://stakecube.net/app/community/faucets
- Let the program run forever and your money will be claimed when they are needed.

## Future Works
- Captcha automation for free.
- Run the program once every 23 hours before the claiming needs to be done.
- Email or SMS notification when the money is above your required faucet claim value.
